# Linear Search
We'll use array for this demonstration.

The process would be
1. Take the array input from the user.
2. Take the search element from the user.
2. Traverse from first element to last node
    2.1 If the search element is matched, break the loop and return the position.
    2.2 If not found, return the element not found.
