# Linked List

Linked list are the type of Data Structure which stores data in non-contiguous way. It stores the data in the form of Node which consist of a property to save data and a pointer which points to the address of next node.

There are major of 6 operations on Linked List
- Appending a Node.
- Prepending a Node.
- Inserting a Node at an index.
- Deleting a Node.
- Updating a Node.

Advantages over Array
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (hence, tends to dynamic size allocation).
- Inserting/Deleting process is easy compared to Array.

Disadvantages over Array
- Random access is not possible.
- Extra memory space for pointer.
- Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contagious, we can store the data continuously. But that's not possible on Linked List.

Types of Linked List
- Singly Linked List.
- Doubly Linked List.
- Circular Linked List.

Applications
- We can use this DS to implement stack and queue as well.
- Linked List can also be used to implement Graphs and Trees as well.
- It can also be used to implement hash tables.
- Functionalities like Undo/Redo can be done using.
